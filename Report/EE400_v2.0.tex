\section{Introduction}
\-\indent 
	I performed my summer practice in ASELSAN A.Ş., one of leading defence industry companies in Turkey. my internship lasted 20 days and Pınar Kırıkkanat, an electronics engineer in ASELSAN was my supervisor and assisted me in my summer practice.

	The summer practice started with an orientation program that briefly explains the company and how the works are handled. Following that, mandatory educations like occupational safety and health education is given to the interns by the company. After the educations, inters were sent to their assigned departments and division. I was similarly sent to HBT division to perform my summer practice.
	
	In the first half of my internship, I was given time to observe, learn and participate the mechanical and electrical test conducted at our division. Mainly on ASELSAN 9661 Series Radios, I mostly observed and participated on the environmental tests of the equipments produced at the Communication \& Information Technologies Vice Presidency, known as HBT. .
	
	In the second part of my internship, I was given time to observe the work done behind the testing, in other words process design and management. In this part of my internship, I participated on documentation and research activities for the ULAK Base station of the ASELSAN. Since the work done at this stage can be mostly considered as classified information, I will mention the basics of what I have done in this part.
	
	In this, report, I start with an introduction, that covers what was done in my summer practice. Then, I continued with a company description section in which the general description about ASELSAN is given. After that part, the work done in my summer practice is explained. Lastly, I finished the report with an conclusion part.

\section{Orientation and Mandatory Education}

\subsection{Orientation}
\- \indent
	My summer practice at ASELSAN started with an orientation program. The program lasted about one day mainly focused on the company and the work done there. Chapter 2 mostly summaries what was covered in the orientation. After the orientation, we were given necessary mandatory educations in order to be allowed to work inside the ASELSAN facilities.  

\subsection{Mandatory Educations}
\- \indent
	As required by the 4857/77  numbered law, all employers in the Republic of Turkey is obligated to train their employees in order to prevent the unnecessary work related accidents. In ASELSAN, we were given obligatory Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Education and Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Education to be able to work in the ASELSAN facilities safely.
	
	
	
\subsubsection{Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Education }
\- \indent

	Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is the sudden flow of electricity between two electrically charged objects caused by contact, an electrical short, or dielectric breakdown. A buildup of static electricity can be caused by tribocharging or by electrostatic induction. The ESD occurs when differently-charged objects are brought close together or when the dielectric between them breaks down, often creating a visible spark. \textbf{[2]}

	A very casual example of electrostatic discharge can be given as lighting. However, not all ESD events are not as loudly or large-scale as lightnings. The less dramatic forms  may be neither seen nor heard, but they can still be large enough to cause damage to sensitive electronic devices. 

	ESD can cause harmful effects of importance in industry, including explosions in gas, fuel vapor and coal dust, as well as failure of solid state electronics components such as integrated circuits. In order to prevent this unwanted side effects of ESD, companies such as ASELSAN prefers to train their workers not just for their health but also protect their product lines. 


\subsubsection{Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Education}
\- \indent

	ASELSAN as a company in Turkey is required to satisfy the conditions deternmined by the 6331 number Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Education Law. 
	
	Occupational safety and health (OSH), also commonly referred to as occupational health and safety (OHS), is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the safety, health, and welfare of people at work. These terms also refer to the goals of this field, so their use in the sense of this article was originally an abbreviation of occupational safety and health program/department etc.\textbf{[3]}

	Occupational safety and health programs aims to foster a safe and healthy work environment. OSH may also protect co-workers, family members, employers, customers, and many others who might be affected by the workplace environment. 

	Just in 2014, 221.336 worker had an work accident imn Turkey and 494 of them suffered from work related diseases. 1.626 workers died due to this accidents according to ÇSGB.\textbf{[4]} The importance of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Educations comes from the fact that these deaths can be prevented if the necessary precautions are taken.

\section{Work Done at SP Company}
\- \indent
	I have performed my summer practice in the Test \& Process Design Department of the \textbf{HBT} Division. In this section, I will mainly explain what I have done in this department throughout my summer practice.
	 
	In my first days I was assigned to observe and participate the tests conducted at the Environmental   Test Laboratory. The test conducted there was mainly on ASELSAN 9661 Series Radios as well as other radio handsets and base stations. I mainly observed the these tests and participated in them as much as I could. I also observed and took part in the test about ASELSAN'S base station named ULAK. 

\subsection{Tests on 9661 Radio Family  }

\subsubsection{ASELSAN 9661 Radio Family}
\- \indent	
	The 9661 HF Radios are a new generation Software Defined Radio covering the HF 1.6-30MHz band. Software configurable architecture enables supporting various radio waveforms and EPM techniques. Beyond line of sight communication is made possible based on the latest HF technology via use of NATO STANAGs and Military Standards. The versatility of waveforms and modes enable communication even in the most hostile HF channel conditions. With the use of technologies such as Automatic Channel

	Selection (ACS) and Automatic Link Establishment (ALE), ease of use is provided while reducing the need for well-trained and experienced operator.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\center
	\setlength{\unitlength}{\textwidth} 
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\unitlength]{radio_type}
	\caption{\label{fig:radtyp}ASELSAN 9661 Radio Series }
\end{figure}

	The radio has embedded Built-In Digital Modem. Modem functionalities in the Software Defined HF Radio are implemented based on several NATO STANAGs and MIL-STD's. While voice and data can be transmitted over a preset fixed frequency, it is also possible to employ an Automatic Channel Selection mechanism which determines the usable frequency for communication. It is possible to communicate under intentional or unintentional interference by using frequency hopping mode of operation.

	9661 HF Radio built-in modem (physical layer) includes Digital Data Waveforms, Automatic Link Establishment and Frequency Hopping. USB, LSB, ISB, AME, AM and CW modulations are supported through 9661 HF Software Defined Radio.

	Digital voice coding/decoding is performed with MELPe vocoder and the data rate for digital voice can be 600, 1200 or 2400 bps. Digital voice communication over fixed frequency can be encrypted. Data communication over fixed frequency can be encrypted or clear. Frequency hopping is the Electronic Protection Measure (EPM) for transmission of digital voice and data.

	9661 HF Radio family has three configurations for Manpack, Vehicle and Fixed Station usage. 20W can be used for Manpack and Vehicle configurations and 150 W can be used for Vehicle and Fixed Station configurations.

\subsubsection{Modulation Fidelity Test}
\- \indent

	Modulation fidelity is the degree of closeness to which the modulation follows the desired ideal therotical modulation.The fidelity is determined by from observations of the signal at the output of an integrate and dump filter, that is preceded by an FM demodulator. The filtered FM modulation trajectories for C4FM and CQPSK are different at all points in time except at the symbol decision points.
	
	The modulation fidelity is measured by determining the rms difference between the actual signal and the ideal C4FM deviation for the transmitted symbols as information.
	
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
 
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
       $$Bits$$ & $$Symbols$$ & $$C4FM Deviation$$ \\ \hline
       00 & +3 & +1.8 kHz  \\ \hline
       01 & +1 & +0.6 kHz  \\ \hline
       10 & -1 & -0.6 kHz  \\ \hline
       11 & -3 & -1.8 kHz  
      
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{modfide}
  \label{tab:modfide}
\end{table}

	Let $s_K$ represents the C4FM deviation of the transmitted symbols, and $z_K$ represents the detected signals at $t_K$ sampling instants.
	
	The transmitter can be modelled as
	
	$$ z_K~=~C_O+C_L*(s_K~+~e_K) $$
	
	where $C_O$ is a constant representing carrier frequency offset and the $C_L$ is another constant called deviation errors that is resulting from gain errors in the transmitter's modulator baseband signal processing. And $e_K$ is called residual deviation error.

\subsection{Outer Space Simulations \& Tests using TVAC  }

%\subsubsection{Thermal Vacuum Chamber (TVAC) }
\- \indent
	A vacuum chamber is a rigid enclosure from which air and other gases are removed by a vacuum pump. This results in a low-pressure environment within the chamber, commonly referred to as a vacuum. A vacuum environment allows researchers to conduct physical experiments or to test mechanical devices which must operate in outer space (for example) or for processes such as vacuum drying or vacuum coating. Chambers are typically made of metals which may or may not shield applied external magnetic fields depending on wall thickness, frequency, resistivity, and permeability of the material used. Only some materials are suitable for vacuum use\cite{tvac}.


\begin{figure}[H]
	\center
	\setlength{\unitlength}{\textwidth} 
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\unitlength]{tvac}
	\caption{\label{fig:tvac}An Example Thermal Vacuum Chamber }
\end{figure}

	A type of these vacuum chambers widely used in the spacecraft engineering field is a thermal vacuum chamber, which can simulate the thermal environment at which a spacecraft would be operating in space. In other words,	a thermal vacuum chamber is a vacuum chamber in which the radiative thermal environment is controlled. One example for this type of chamber can be seen at \textit{Figure~\ref{fig:tvac}} which is used in NASA.


	There are two thermal vacuum chambers with different capacities in the ASELSAN HBT Facilities. They are used mainly for the outer space simulation tests of the electronics parts of the TURKSAT 6A Project. The chambers can also be used by other project partners such as TAI and TURKSAT if needed.
	
	To simulate the outer space, the pressure in the chamber must be reduced to $10^{-5}~mBar$ or below to satisfy the requirements for the test. This was done by pulling the oxygen and other major atmospheric gases and pumping liquid nitrogen to the system to push leftover gases. Liquid Nitrogen is also used to reach the required minimum temperature for the test.
	
	According to the device under test's physical properties, two ways are used to reach the desired maximum temperature. One of them is using spacial thermal plates below the device. If the device should not be in contact with directly heat source second method for heating can be used.  That is to use the infrared heaters inside the chambers.
	
\begin{figure}[H]
	\center
	\setlength{\unitlength}{\textwidth} 
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\unitlength]{tvac-cycle}
	\caption{\label{fig:tvac-cycle}An Example Temperature Cycle }
\end{figure}


	 To initialize the test, the atmospheric pressure inside the vacuum is reduced to $10^{-5}~mBar$ or below at room temperature. The device is expected to operate in such pressure levels, therefore, the pressure level is conserved until the last cycle by the PID controller inside the chamber. After the necessary pressure requirements is met, the temperature is set according to the customer's will, in our case customer was TURKSAT A.Ş. as owner of TURKSAT 6A. An example test cycle for testing the device under test can be seen at \textit{Figure~\ref{fig:tvac-cycle}}. Between each temperature change, the temperature inside the chamber is left unchanged up to six hours to ensure the stability of the operation of the device at that temperate. This can be done by taking the necessary measurement with half hours intervals. If the data are consistent with previous, temperature will be changed for next cycle. Unfortunately, I was not allowed the take screenshots for the test results or took pictures of other test steps,  I will not be able to give further information about this topic.

\section{Conclusion}

\-
\indent I completed my summer practice in ASELSAN A.Ş.(ASELSAN Electronics Industry and Ticaret A.Ş.) in supervision of Pınar Kırıkkanat, an electronics engineer in ASELSAN, in Yenimahalle/Ankara. It was quite experiential time for me. Throughout my summer practice, I learned many things about professional work life. 

	Firstly, I understodd the importance of mandatory educations like occupational safety and health education thanks to given educations by ASELSAN. After the educations, I was  sent to my division, where I performed my summer practice.
	
	In the first half of my internship, I was given time to observe, learn and participate the mechanical and electrical test conducted at our division. Mainly on ASELSAN 9661 Series Radios, I mostly observed and participated on the environmental tests of the equipments produced at the Communication \& Information Technologies Vice Presidency, known as HBT. .
	
	In the second part of my internship, I was given time to observe the work done behind the testing, in other words process design and management. In this part of my internship, I participated on documentation and research activities for the ULAK Base station of the ASELSAN. Since the work done at this stage can be mostly considered as classified information, I will mention the basics of what I have done in this part.
	
	In this, report, I start with an introduction, that covers what was done in my summer practice. Then, I continued with a company description section in which the general description about ASELSAN is given. After that part, the work done in my summer practice is explained. Lastly, I finished the report with an conclusion part. 
		
	
	Finally, I recommend my summer practice company for other students who want to start their summer practice at ASELSAN.
